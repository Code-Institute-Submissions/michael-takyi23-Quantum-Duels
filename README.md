## Purpose

The goal of the site is to provide a reliable source of information pertaining to the history of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.

## UX Design

### User stories

**As a first time user**

- I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the topic.
- I am interested in the historical facts surrounding the person.
- I want to be able to easily navigate and find content.

**All users want to be able to access and comfortably view the website on mobile devices**

# Description

Quantum Duels follows the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock but with a quantum twist! Test your skills and strategy against a quantum opponent.

## Features

## Features Left to Implement

- In the future I want to implement the hamburger drop down menu for smaller devices to enable easy accessibility to save enough space on screens.

## Technologies used

### Validator Testing

- HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- CSS: No errors were returned when passing through the official ( Jigsaw ) validator.
- Accessibility: I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.

### Bugs

- I realised that when I scroll to the right on mobile devices, there is white space on the right side of the page especially the header which i have tried to adjust but the problem persisted.
- I realised I had added width to the footer and a margin of 1em to the header element.
- removing the width of the footer and the margin of 1em from the header for screens 768px and 468px solved fixed the problem.

## Deployment

This website was deployed to Github pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- Find pages then click on pages and find Build and Deployment
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
