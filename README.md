### Bugs

- I realised that when I scroll to the right on mobile devices, there is white space on the right side of the page especially the header which i have tried to adjust but the problem persisted.
- I realised I had added width to the footer and a margin of 1em to the header element.
- removing the width of the footer and the margin of 1em from the header for screens 768px and 468px solved fixed the problem.
